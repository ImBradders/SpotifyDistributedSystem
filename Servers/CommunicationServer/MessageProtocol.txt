Intro
This is the message protocol that the Communication Server will use. 
The idea behind the Communication Server is to act as a load balancer between the other online servers - keeping clients always connected whereever possible.
In order to handle this, the Communication Server will allow clients to connect to it where they will be assigned a server to connect to in order for music to be delivered.
